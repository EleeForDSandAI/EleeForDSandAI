    "This was fantastic!! I already had cooked the chicken thighs so I didn’t use the instant pot to cook the chicken. At that step, I put the shredded chicken into the pot with the liquid and seasonings and set it to high pressure for 3 minutes to get it boiling. Then followed the rest of the directions. I did add a little more chicken stock after it was cooked as it seemed too thick. But my family LOVED it!! Will definitely be making this again.\n",

    "Good basic recipe but lacked seasoning and was very bland as-is. Next time, I would add a lot more herbs and spices as well as more salt.\n",

    "10/02/2021\n",
    "I’ve made this at least a dozen times now over the past year. It’s a family favorite. I tweak it for our family by omitting the chicken breasts (it was too much meat for us & the thighs taste better), increasing the dumpling recipe by 50%, and I sometimes sub corn for the green beans. It’s amazing!\n",
    "JoanVan\n",
    "08/30/2021\n",
    "I loved this recipe but I did make some changes. I like thighs so I used only thighs with bone in. I thought the sauce should be thicker so I doubled the flour and butter and next time I will triple the flour. But the best thing I did was follow another suggestion and that is to pressure the dumplings for 10 minutes on low. It worked so well. Otherwise I had to pour out the stew into another pan and cook the dumplings on top of the stew on the stove. I'm not going there again.\n",

    "I thought the dumplings would be light an fluffy. The chicken stew was wonderful, just need to find a different dumpling recipe.\n",
